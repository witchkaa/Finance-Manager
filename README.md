# Finance-Manager
Planning your budget can be a hard thing as not everybody has the financial management skills. It can be hard for some to keep in mind all their financial plans, so it is essential to find a way to cope with it - use a paper planner, or download this application. This console app is designed to help the user plan their budget. You can add planned expenses and incomes, save them in the app, see your current balance, view other useful information on your budget.


Currently, the user interface is console and the storage mechanism is file serialization. It can be easily changed to GUI or DB by implementing UserInterface and StorageProcessor interfaces.
